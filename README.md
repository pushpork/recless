Single file public domain (Zero-Clause BSD) libraries for C/C++.

These libraries are implementations of algorithms I find myself repeatedly
implementing in projects or experiments from my spare time.

Each library should be self contained and simple enough to just drop-in to any
project you may have. Where possible, macro overrides can be used to customise
some aspects of each library (e.g. alternate `malloc()` implementations).
